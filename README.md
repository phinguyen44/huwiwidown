This project provides a handy template for writing a dissertation or Bachelor's/
Master's Thesis at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin School of Business and
Economics and rendering those files in a PDF format following the Humboldt LaTeX
template found [here](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/vwl/oe/teaching/theses/latex-thesis-template/view).

Users write in `R Markdown` (which is basically a flavor of the `Markdown`
markup language but with the ability to incorporate R code chunks using the
`knitr` package), and the `bookdown` package (powered by
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org) is used to convert the code into LaTeX code and
finally into a PDF document. There's other formats that can be created too, such
as html documents, but that is outside the scope of this package.

In the event that you've never used `bookdown` before, check out this [handy
tutorial](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

## Introduction

Why use this instead of the provided LaTeX template? Though LaTeX is an
incredibly powerful tool, the learning curve can be difficult and a lot of time
is spent wasted on finding the correct formatting. This package sacrifices
some of the expressiveness of LaTeX for the ease of use of Markdown, to allow
the end user to focus on writing good content.

Markdown is a much easier-to-use, lightweight, no-frills markup language. The
good news is that users can still inject LaTeX code directly into the Markdown
pages, in the event he/she still wants to write in LaTeX.

This thesis will contain minor differences to the due to limitations in the
pandoc output, but in general the appearance is almost entirely identical.

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. To install the template, be sure you have the following:
  - [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)
  - [LaTeX][(https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
  - [R >= 3.5.1](https://r-project.org)
  - [RStudio](https://rstudio.org) (optional, but it helps)
2. Install the necessary packages:

```
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.org")
}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
devtools::install_github("phister/huwiwidown")
```
3. Create a New R Markdown document:

File -> New File -> R Markdown... then choose 'From template', then choose
'HU Thesis", and enter `index` as the **Name**. Note that this will currently
only **Knit** if you name the directory `index` at this step.

If you're not using RStudio, navigate to an empty directory and then run the
following code:

```r
rmarkdown::draft("index.Rmd", template = "hu_thesis", package = "huwiwidown")
```

### Rendering

To render your thesis, you can open `index.Rmd` in RStudio and then hit the
"knit" button. Alternatively, you can use:

```r
rmarkdown::render("index.Rmd")
```

Your thesis will be deposited in the `thesis-output/` directory.

## Components

The following describes the components in the template.

### `index.Rmd`

This file is first created when generating a new template. It contains all the
relevant meta-information (e.g. name, thesis title, advisor names). You will
need to fill out the sections at the top of the page, which will then auto-
populate your "Title Page" and "Declaration of Authorship". If you are also
familiar with the YAML header, you can also add additional LaTeX parameters or
decide whether you want to add optional pages to your thesis such as the
"Acknowledgements" section or the "List of Tables".

### `_bookdown.yml`

This is the main configuration file for your thesis. It determines what Rmd
files are included in the output, and in what order. Arrange the order of your
chapters in this file and ensure that the names match the names in your folders.
The first file should always be the `index.Rmd` file. The rest will be the files
that you create. Some example files are already included to help you along your
way.

### `sections/`

These are the sections or chapters that will be bound together in the final
render. Here's where you write the sections that make your thesis. You can name
the files whatever you like, so long as they are indexed in the `_bookdown.yml`
file.

Note that you will not need to change `98-references.Rmd` as the bibliography
will be auto-generated in alphabetically order so long as you cite that item
in the text and your bibliography is correctly located in `bib/references.bib`.
References should stay in that position to ensure it appears after the text but
before the appendix.

### `bib/`

Store your bibliography (as `bibtex` files) here.
[This website](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) may be helpful in generating the
`bibtex` file in the correct format.

### `figures/` and `data/`

Store your figures and data here and reference them in your R Markdown files.

## Structure of Thesis (Suggested)

In general, the HU suggests the following structure for the thesis, and what
files in the template they correspond to:

**Frontmatter:**

- titlepage (mandatory, auto-generated from template)
- acknowledgement (`prelim/00-acknowledge.Rmd`)
- abstract (`prelim/00-abstract.Rmd`)
- table of contents (mandatory, auto-generated from template)
- list of abbreviations (not mandatory, (`prelim/00-abbreviations.Rmd`))
- list of figures (not mandatory, auto-generated from template))
- list of tables  (not mandatory, auto-generated from template))

**Body:** the structure of the thesis body is not mandatory, but the references
are:

- introduction (`sections/01-intro.Rmd`)
- methods (`sections/02-method.Rmd`)
- data (`sections/03-data.Rmd`)
- results (`sections/04-results.Rmd`)
- conclusion (`sections/05-conclusion.Rmd`)
- references (mandatory, auto-generated from template)
- appendix (not mandatory, `sections/99-appendix.Rmd`)

**Last page:**

- declaration of authorship (mandatory, auto-generated from template)
